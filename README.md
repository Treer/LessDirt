# Less Dirt texturepack for Minetest

Extends the grass growth on the side of blocks so rolling hills show less exposed bare dirt. Also does the same for snow, forest litter, moss, etc.

This improves screenshots in a similar fashion to [Landscape redo](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=20032) but doesn't alter nodes.

Removes a piece of Minecraft's legacy that Notch might not have gotten right. Currently it only has the Minetest Game and MineClone 2 textures in it, but others could be added.

## Wanted

This texture pack needn't be limited to Minetest Game, it could include the same texture updates for other games and mods that run on Minetest. Just remember to include attributions in LICENCE.txt in the pull request.
